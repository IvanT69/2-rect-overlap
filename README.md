This code first defines the rectangles by its bottom-left and top-right corners:  
Rect A: (x1, y1) to (x2, y2)  
Rect B: (x3, y3) to (x4, y4)  
  
Then, checks whether the rectangle overlaps or not.  
Two rectangles will not overlap if one is completely to the left, right, below or top.  
If the rectangles overlap, it sends out a message saying that they overlap, if not it will say they do not overlap.
